Varda Vault secret NFT content locker
==================================


This repo is built to connect all NEAR NFTs to unlockable content.
The contract is quite simple. It can store the account_id of last sender and return all the owned NFTs along with unlockable contente related to them.
The interface allows to lock new content to the owned NFTs.

## Lock secret content

We suggest to upload the unlockable content to IPFS using [pinata service](https://pinata.cloud/pinmanager)
Once the content is uploaded copy the file url from pinata, login to the [Varda Vault](www.varda.vision/vault/index.html) scroll till the "lock secret content" button appears and click it, add the link to your owned NFT in the form and follow the steps to connect the immutable link to your NFT.
Editing link once saved is possible but you'll need to pay a 1 near fee, please contact jilt (at) jeeltcraft (dot) com if needed.


### redeem secret content

Secret content is available only to the NFT token owner.
Access the [Varda Vault](www.varda.vision/vault/index.html) and click the button "redeem secret content". Add the link to your owned NFT in the form and follow the steps to get the URL to your exclusive file.
